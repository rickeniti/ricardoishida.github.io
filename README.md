## Work Experience
**Data Analyst @ Amazon (_June 2019 - October 2023_)**
- Built a dashboard to consume real-time data on ***Tableau*** to monitor over 60k order status per day of 942 seller partners. The dashboard was replicated to 3 different countries and benchmarked by other two.
- Created a dashboard on ***Tableau*** to manage 3 main seller's performance KPI’s, consuming information via ***SQL*** from 3 different data clusters and 13 different tables hosted on ***AWS Redshift***. This report was used by 5 internal teams and was replicated to Mexico.
- Developed a ***Python*** bot to send massive customizable messages to more than 2,000 seller partners according to their respective number of pending packages. This bot was used by 4 different teams and replicated to 3 other countries, saving 3 weekly hours of each team member.
- Led a BI team with two members, setting the 2023 planning as well as discussing project prioritization with teams in Mexico and MENA (Middle East North Africa).

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
